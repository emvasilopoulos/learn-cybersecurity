reconnaissance --> anagnorisi

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) --> 

white box assessment --> Assess for vulnerabilities with source code & running application

black box assessment --> Assess for vulnerabilities WITHOUT source code. You only get the deployed app.
			 Most typical for external network pen-tests + social engineering

gray box assessment --> Something in between. Some information is provided to reduce reconnaissance time.

vulnerability assessment --> use automatic vulnerability scanner (less accurate, faster) | Not enough for a professional job
penetration testing --> Manual (more accurate, slower)

Network Penetration Testing --> Identify flaws in systems, networks, network devices (e.g. switches & routers)
Network Penetration Testing tasks:
	1. Bypassing an Intrusion Detection System or Intrusion Prevention System
	2. Bypassing firewall appliances
	3. Password cracking
	4. Gaining access to end devices and servers
	5. Exploiting misconfigurations on switches and routers
