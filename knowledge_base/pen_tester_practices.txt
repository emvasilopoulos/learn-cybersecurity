1. Find vulnerabilities with tools and techniques

2. Exploits first the easiest vulnerabilities and then the more complex

3. Presents vulnerabilities and possible solutions (patches)

4. Creates battle plan:
	a. Pre-Engagement
		i. Obtain legal permission
		ii. Rules of engagement (define scope of pen test, what you can and cant hack).
		    Sample questions to help define scope (a non-extensive list):
			- What is the size/class of your external network? (network pen test)
			- What is the size/class of your internal network? (network pen test)
			- What is the purpose and goal of the pen test?
			- How many pages does the web app have? (web app pen test)
			- How many user inputs or forms does the web app have?
		iii. Non-Disclosure Agreement between client & provider
		iv. Begin Pen test
	b. Information Gathering
		Examples --> Find points of entry. Identify employees, infrastructure, geolocation of physical access, network details, servers etc. 

	c. Threat Modeling
		Some frameworks as examples:
			- STRIDE --> Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of server, Elevation of privilige
			- PASTA  --> Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

	d. Vulnerability Analysis
		- Scan network and ports
		- Analyze for vulnerabilities
	e. Exploitation
		- Ways of taking advantage of vulnerabilities
		- Malicious code
	f. Post-Exploitation
		- Access data
		- Spread to other systems
	g. Report Writing
		- Pen testing is the service
		- Report writing is the deliverable to the customer
		- Convey risk and business impact
		- Summarize findings
		- Includes remediation steps
